      <description>Hey, thanks for reading! My name is Codey Oxley and I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer.
Reviewing code is one of my favorite things to do. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I like learning intricacies of systems, and passing them on. But most importantly I care about code quality1 &amp;mdash; a lot.
I believe when we lower the friction to write good code by giving thorough examples in reviews, we see the biggest impact.</description>

      <description>Python loggers can be configured a million ways. That’s too much.
We can ease the pain by sticking to consistent practices. Outlined below are the most common issues that I see projects run into.
Naming Like modules, loggers are hierarchical. Their names should follow the import path of where they’re running. Loggers that stray from this are hard to work with. Use __name__ everywhere to get this for free.</description>
